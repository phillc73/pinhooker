Description: The pinhooker package provides a ready to use data set, in the
    form of a CSV file, for a global collection of thoroughbred bloodstock
    sales since 2009. Also included are functions and scripts in order to
    collate custom data sets, for example from a specific vendor, year or
    sale. Data has been normalised across vendors in order to generate
    consistent data sets.
